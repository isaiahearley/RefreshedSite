                        I've had several careers throughout the past 4 years which have helped me gain a variety of skills including <span class="important">customer service, project planning, troubleshooting hardware + software, and scripting.</span> I started my career
                        at palomar college where I was given the opportunity to participate in work-study and earn income while being in school full-time. Although my time with Palomar College lasted for 1 year I was able to get valuable 
                        skills in <span class="important">communication</span> and <span class="important">staying organized</span> at work. Afterwards I worked at Walmart as a sales associate and climbed to a variety of positions within the same store with my last position there being a merchandise 
                        reconcilation supervisor. After Walmart I transitioned my career into <span class="important">Information Technology</span> and was able to grasp important concepts in both <span class="important">hardware and software troubleshooting.</span> My time at Micro Center was 
                        spent <span class="important">assisting up to 20+ customers daily, creating tickets, closing tickets and keeping constant communication</span> with various customers. This fast-paced environment prepared me for my next job with Science 
                        Applications International Corporation as a <span class="important">IT Service Desk Analyst.</span> In this role I was given the privilege to <span class="important">support 600k+ Navy civilians, military and contractors </span> with by <span class="important">providing IT software support</span> on a variety of issues with software ranging from 
                        Citrix, Adobe and Microsoft 365 applications. I was also given the opportunity to assist callers in mission critical assignments that were crucial in the scope of NMCI. After my time with the service desk I was contacted by my current company; <a class="important" href="https://issits.com/" target="_blank" title="Current Company I work for!">Information System Solutions</a>, which offered 
                        my current  position, <span class="important">"Windows System Administrator".</span> In this role I've gained a tremendous amount of scripting knowledge, primarily with the PowerShell language, and have created scripts to automate our
                        workflow. Some notable contributions I have made so far include:
